# Compare Latent Spaces for AMP design
In this repo we put the code for training the deep learning models we examined, the code used for analyzing their latent spaces, and figure generation ipython notebooks. Additionally the bayesian optimization code we used is available. Datasets and model checkpoints are available on zenodo.
